You may implement this from Foundation Code, HW1, or your TP1 code. You pick a subset of user stories from \"Student\" that you think best cover what is required for CRUD/input validation - it's vague because it is up to your best judgement. \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. Input validation is how you make sure your database is secure when allowing users to enter things directly into your database. If you're taking 365, think SQL injection and all the things that can go wrong there.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Note that it is standalone. I don't think this means it isn't related to HW1 or our team projects -- Instead, I think it means it is a more simple adaptation, requiring only enough to get these basic functionalities in place and not worry about roles and their effect on what a user can do. It is to practice on a smaller scale and get a working idea of what we will implement, before we actually implement it into the team project. \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "You should think like this too! It's just a mini version of the Q&A system we are developing.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n" + "In the document it says to create:\r\n" + "\r\n" + "a question class\r\n" + "\r\n"
				+ "an answer class\r\n" + "\r\n"
				+ "a questions class that supports storing all current questions as well as any subset of the questions (e.g., a subset reflecting the results of a search)\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "an answers class that supports storing all potential answers to all stored questions and any subset of potential answers to a question (e.g., a subset reflecting the results of a search)\r\n"
				+ "\r\n" + "Lets look a little deeper here. \r\n" + "\r\n"
				+ "The question class represents a single question and all of the data associated with it (Think: how are questions displayed on EdDiscussion? What information do they have?) Same with the answer class, but for answers to questions. Think about that relationship.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "What about the last two? (TAs please correct me if I'm wrong) I think these are to manage a collection of questions/answers, maybe like a category of questions (on EdDiscussion, \"Assignments\" questions vs \"Exams\" questions) or answers related to a question (q: \"What is the meaning of life?\", answers: \"42\", \"Playing with my dog\", \"Making an impact\" (where the question and answer classes are just simple strings). What might that data look like? How might we interact with it? Remember we can have multiple collections, collections that are empty, have a few entries, or that 1000s of entries. Do some research on collections of data like this, it'll help a lot down the line.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "We are urged to discuss \"potential attributes\" for these classes with each other on EdDiscussion. Again, this is vague because it is up to you! Talk to others about these and learn from others' previous experiences.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Documentation and automated testing is still important. Use JavaDoc comments for documentation, they're pretty cool. Automated testing is like in TP1 still. No need to worry about JUnit, if you don't want to. \r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Read the deliverables and note theres a lot planning, documentation, diagrams, and testing in the deliverable PDF. And finally a screencast to explain and show off your work. K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple silly) method for the screencast, so you don't bore your grader :P \r\n"
